### DSC-NSEC : Logo-generator
# Overview 
The project was an upgrade to the existing Logo-generator by DSC-NSEC. It was made to help the communities by providing a tool to generate there logos hassle free. 
During the winter I worked to improve the project in terms of code disciplines and also added some features to the project.
I am Ayush an undergrad from NSEC, Kolkata, as part of Winter of Code 2020.

This project was mentored by Vishwajeet bhaiya and Aniket bhaiya.

  - ### Refactor of code from State component to functional component
     Initially the Project was using React state component we migrated into functional component to make the code more readable and to fit with new paradigm of React. This was a fun task for me cause this introduced me to the new features of React which I found very simple and interesting. I can say that it was one of the major takeaways from the WOC.
  - ### Typescript Migration 
     I migrated the project code base to Typescript which was initially using JavaScript as its base. It added the Type to the existing JavaScript code which improved the structure and  discipline of the project and will continue to do so in future developments.
- ### Minor UI updates
     Addition of a App bar.
- ### Authentication
     #### Deliverables
     - Native login and signup page
     - Using firebase as backend
     - OAuth via google
     - Restricting downloads to the authorized users
     - basic profile for the login user
     #### My Contributions
     In this task, the main thing to consider was adding authentication in such fashion so that the user can see the product without even setting up an account but they have to signup for using it.
     I found the modal view of the login/signup page best for this scenario and after mentor's permission,  I finalized the design.
     This was the most interesting task for me cause I learned too many stuffs while working on the task. 
    Coming back to my contributions, I used firebase as the backend for the project and implemented the authentication as it was finalized. Updated the UI for supporting the authentication. Then, I added the feature for preventing the user from downloading the logo if the user is not authorized. Finally, I also added the feature of OAuth.
    In the process of task completion, Vishwajeet bhaiya helped me with my problems and Aniket bhaiya guided me the path for achieving the desired outcome. Here is the link for my PR for the particular task [#16](https://github.com/dscnsec/logo-generator/pull/16)
 
# New features
- User signup
- user can login/logout and personalized view of the app.
- OAuth( signup/login using google)
- preventing from download if user is not authorized.
- some basic UI updates

Here are some of my PR's
- [#16- PR for authentication](https://github.com/dscnsec/logo-generator/pull/16)
- [#14- PR for typescript migration](https://github.com/dscnsec/logo-generator/pull/14)
- [#7- PR for code refactor](https://github.com/dscnsec/logo-generator/pull/7)

# Small bugs
There are no bugs in the project in the work that has been done. But we need to add the logo save feature and a separate profile page for the user. I am working on that part and will submit a PR soon.
# Future Scope
The work that I did during the winter will help the project in making a relation with the user and will put the foundation of the future development of the product. As we used the functional component it will also help the future contributor's in easily understanding the code base. Typescript's discipline will make the code bug free.
# Overall Experience
The overall experience was really amazing during the winter and enjoyed a lot contributing to this generous project. Learned a lot from the mentor, they helped me a lot during this one month journey. It was a journey full of experiences from which some will stay with me forever. My teammate Piyush bhaiya helped me in my initial days and supported throughout the journey. At the end, I want to say that , "The winter was full of experiences and learnings."
